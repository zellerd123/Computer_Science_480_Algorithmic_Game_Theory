# Computer_Science_480_Algorithmic_Game_Theory
This is an actively updating repository for Algorithmic Game Theory, a class currently being taken in Spring 2024
**CS 480A: Algorithmic Game Theory**
This repository contains my work for the CS 480A: Algorithmic Game Theory course, an exploration into the intersection of computer science, economics, and game theory. The course focuses on understanding how algorithms operate within strategic environments, such as markets, auctions, and voting systems. All lab assignments are implemented in Julia, a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language well-suited for numerical and computational science.

**About the Course**
Algorithmic Game Theory combines algorithms, game theory, and economic theory to study systems with multiple agents whose interactions are strategic in nature. The course covers:

Game Theory Basics: Nash equilibria, dominant strategies, mechanism design.
Auction Theory and Mechanisms: Design and analysis of auction systems.
Market Equilibria: Algorithms for computing market equilibria.
Cooperative Game Theory: Solutions concepts in cooperative scenarios.
Network Games: Game-theoretic models of network formation and traffic.
**Lab Projects**
Each lab focuses on a specific topic within Algorithmic Game Theory, applying Julia to solve complex problems and simulate strategic interactions. Highlights include:

**Lab 1: Nash Equilibrium Simulations**
Objective: Implement algorithms to find Nash equilibria and dominant/dominated strategies in various game settings.
**Lab 2: explore Price-of-Anarchy (POA) results in selfish routing networks.**
Objective: Design and analyze POA under different monomials and different price algorithms 
**Lab 3: create and solve linear programming models in Julia.**
Objective: Create LP to choose an optimal (profit-maximizing) subset of choices under different circumstances.
**Lab 4: Mixed Equilibria and Zero-Sum Games**
Objective: Simulate games and solve for equilibria 
**Labs Ongoing...**


**Tools Used**: Julia, game theory libraries, Visual Studio
